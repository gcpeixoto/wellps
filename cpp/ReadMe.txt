=======================
     CPP directory
=======================

This folder contains C++ pre-compiled executables
that are invoked inside specific functions:

- Makefile: standard compilation rules (as is)

- mainGraphMetrics: this executable is invoked 
  by 'computeDRTGraphMetrics' and creates a 
  wrap to SNAP in order to compute graph centrality 
  metrics.
